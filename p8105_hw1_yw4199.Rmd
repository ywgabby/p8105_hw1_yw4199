Problem 1

Load the moderndive library. 
```{r, message = FALSE}
library("moderndive")
library("tidyverse")
```

Load the early_january_weather dataset.
```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
view(early_january_weather)
```

```{r}
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

```{r}
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

Make a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points using the humid variable.

Export your scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.
```{r}
ggplot(early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()



```
Export your scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.
```{r}
ggsave("p8105_hw1_yw4199_scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

Problem 2
```{r}
