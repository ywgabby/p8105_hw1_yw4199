\#Problem 1

Load the moderndive library.

``` r
library("moderndive")
library("tidyverse")
```

Load the early_january_weather dataset.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
view(early_january_weather)
```

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

Make a scatterplot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x); color points using the
humid variable.

Export your scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_yw4199_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

Export your scatterplot to your project directory using ggsave.

``` r
ggsave("p8105_hw1_yw4199_scatter_plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

\#Problem 2

Create a data frame

``` r
normal_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(10, mean = 1), 
  #a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  #a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
  vector = sample(letters, 10, replace = TRUE),
  #a character vector of length 10
  factor = as.factor(sample(1:3, 10, replace = TRUE))
  #a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”
)
```

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe

``` r
mean(pull(normal_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.9627368

``` r
mean(pull(normal_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(pull(normal_df, vector))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(normal_df, vector)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(normal_df, factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(normal_df, factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

For vector and factor variables they return NA because they are neither
numeric or logical. For the first numeric variable, it returns
0.8553194; and for the second variable, since it is logical variable, it
will treat F as 0 and T as 1 and then return the mean for all the
values.

Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the logical,
character, and factor variables.

``` r
norm_samp_pos_num = as.numeric(normal_df$norm_samp_pos) #convert logical variable to numeric
vector_num = as.numeric(normal_df$vector) #convert vector to numeric
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
factor_num = as.numeric(normal_df$factor) #convert factor to numeric
```
